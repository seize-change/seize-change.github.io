                             A 3 month sailing journey through the Inside Passage to raise awareness of marine debris. Along the way, we will perform beach cleanups along the remote coastlines of BC and Alaska, and collect data as citizen scientists to support conservation research. We are reframing the face of adventure, and inspiring others to be stewards of the earth as they venture into the outdoors.

                    <p style="text-align:justify">We are four friends: Mathilde Gordon, Daniel Greenwood, Kirsten Mathison, and Nic Annau, passionate about the protection of our oceans, and connected by our love for the outdoors. We are a team of cavers, climbers, kayakers, circus performers, astronomers, engineers, scientists, educators and campaigners, with various complimentary (and some completely random) skills. We haven’t spent more than a few days at a time together, and hail from different sides of the Pacific Ocean, but we are uniting for a cause close to our hearts. </p>

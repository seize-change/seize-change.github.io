                    <p style="text-align:justify">We are four friends: Mathilde Gordon, Daniel Greenwood, Kirsten Mathison, and Nic Annau, passionate about the protection of our oceans, and connected by our love for the outdoors. We are a team of cavers, climbers, kayakers, circus performers, astronomers, engineers, scientists, educators and campaigners, with various complimentary (and some completely random) skills. We haven’t spent more than a few days at a time together, and hail from different sides of the Pacific Ocean, but we are uniting for a cause close to our hearts. </p>
                    <h2>Our Project</h2>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">We are planning a 3 month sailing journey through the Inside Passage to raise awareness, and collect data, of marine debris along the coastlines of BC and Alaska.  We hope to reframe the face of adventure and inspire others to be stewards of the earth as they venture into the outdoors. </p>
                    <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">To be a vessel for citizen science and community partnerships</p>

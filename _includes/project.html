                     A 3 month sailing journey to circumnavigate Vancouver Island to raise awareness of marine debris. Along the way, we will perform beach cleanups along the remote coastlines of Vancouver Island, and collect data as citizen scientists to support conservation research. We are reframing the face of adventure, and inspiring others to be stewards of the earth as they venture into the outdoors.

						It seems today that every mountain top has been climbed, every river kayaked down
						and every valley traversed. Whilst these journeys are incredibly inspiring, adventure doesn’t
						always need to be about pushing the limits and branching into “new” and exciting territory.
						Reframing the face of adventure is about continuing to appreciate and explore our natural
						world, whilst maintaining these sanctuaries for the benefit of the environment, ourselves, and
						future generations to come. We hope our adventure will inspire others to pursue their own,
						and also encourage people to begin their journey to protecting our beautiful oceans.
